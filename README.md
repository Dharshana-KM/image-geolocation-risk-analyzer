# Image Geolocation Risk Analyzer

A web-based forensic tool that extracts GPS metadata,
device model, and timestamp from digital images.

If GPS data exists, the system generates a Google Maps link.
If metadata is stripped (e.g., WhatsApp images),
it detects and reports it.

Developed using Python & Gradio.
